# Matrix (WOP)
This project was made from my previous project for C -> [link](https://github.com/dimanchique/C_Matrix)

C++ 14

Here I'm using fixed size std::vector to store float data of matrix. Supporting functions: inverse, det, T, multiply, etc.

P.S. No build needed, just load .c/.h files to your project!
